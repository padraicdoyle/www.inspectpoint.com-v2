1. Your Agreement with Inspectpoint
<br>
<br>
1.1 Your use of the Inspect Point service is governed by this agreement (the "Terms"). "Inspect Point" means Inspect Point LLC, and its subsidiaries or affiliates involved in providing the Inspect Point Services. The “Inspect Point Services” means the services Inspect Point makes available through its website, including this website, the Inspect Point cloud computing platform, the Inspect Point API, the Inspect Point Add-ons, and any other software or services offered by Inspect Point in connection to any of the foregoing.

<br>
<br>
1.2 In order to use the Inspect Point Services, you must first agree to the Terms.
<br>
<br>

1.3 You may not use the Inspect Point Services if you are a person barred from receiving the Inspect Point Services under the laws of the United States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Inspect Point Services. You affirm that you are over the age of 18, as the Inspect Point Services are not intended for individuals under the age of 18.

<br>
<br>
1.4 You agree your purchases of Inspect Point Services are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by Inspect Point or any of its affiliates regarding future functionality or features.
<br>
<br>
2. Your Account and Use of the Inspect Point Services
<br>
<br>
2.1 You must provide accurate and complete registration information any time you register to use the Inspect Point Services.

If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account, you agree to notify Inspect Point immediately.

<br>
<br>

2.3 You agree not to (a) access (or attempt to access) the administrative interface of the Inspect Point Services by any means other than through the interface that is provided by Inspect Point in connection with the Inspect Point Services, unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement in writing signed by a duly authorized representative of Inspect Point, or (b) engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Inspect Point Services (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Inspect Point Services).
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). Charges are exclusive of taxes. You are responsible for paying all taxes and government charges, and all reasonable expenses and attorneys fees Inspect Point incurs collecting late amounts. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). To the fullest extent permitted by law, refunds (if any) are at the discretion of Inspect Point and only in the form of credit for the Inspect Point Services. Nothing in these Terms obligates Inspect Point to extend credit to any party. You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Inspect Point may be shared by Inspect Point with companies who work on Inspect Point's behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Inspect Point and servicing your account. Inspect Point may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. Inspect Point shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties. Inspect Point reserves the right to discontinue the provision of the Inspect Point Services to you for any late payments.
<br>
<br>

4.3 Inspect Point may change its fees and payment policies for the Inspect Point Services by notifying you at least fifteen (15) days before the beginning of the billing cycle in which such change will take effect. Changes to the fees or payment policies will be posted on the Inspect Point website (or such other URL Inspect Point may provide from time to time). Any outstanding balance becomes immediately due and payable upon termination of the Terms for any reason.
<br>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

14.3 You acknowledge and agree that Inspect Point is not liable for any loss or damage which may be incurred by you as a result of the availability of those external sites or resources, or as a result of any reliance placed by you on the completeness, accuracy or existence of any advertising, products or other materials on, or available from, such web sites or resources.
<br>
<br>
15. Changes to the Terms
<br>
<br>
15.1 Inspect Point may make changes to the Terms from time to time. If we change the Terms in any substantive way, you will have (30) days before the changes take effect, during which period of time you may reject the changes by terminating your account.
<br>
<br>

15.2 You understand and agree that if you use the Inspect Point Services after the date on which the Terms have changed, Inspect Point will treat your use as acceptance of the updated Terms.
<br>
<br>
16. General Legal Terms
<br>
<br>
16.1 The Terms and the agreements referenced herein constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Inspect Point and govern your use of the Inspect Point Services (but excluding any services which Inspect Point may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replace any prior agreements between you and Inspect Point in relation to the Inspect Point Services.
<br>
<br>

16.2 There are no third party beneficiaries to these Terms. The parties are independent contractors, and nothing in these Terms creates an agency, partnership or joint venture.
<br>
<br>

16.3 If Inspect Point provides you with a translation of the English language version of these Terms, the English language version of these Terms will control if there is any conflict.
<br>
<br>

16.4 You agree that Inspect Point may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Inspect Point website. By providing Inspect Point your email address, you consent to our using the email address to send you any notices required by law in lieu of communication by postal mail.
<br>
<br>

16.5 You agree that if Inspect Point does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which Inspect Point has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Inspect Point's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Inspect Point.
<br>
<br>

16.6 Inspect Point shall not be liable for failing or delaying performance of its obligations resulting from any condition beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to, governmental action, acts of terrorism, earthquake, fire, flood or other acts of God, labor conditions, power failures, and Internet disturbances.
<br>
<br>

16.7 The Terms, and your relationship with Inspect Point under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Inspect Point agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Saratoga, NY to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms.
<br>
<br>

16.8 Neither party may assign any of its rights or obligations under these Terms, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other party (not to be unreasonably withheld). Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may assign the entirety of its rights and obligations under these Terms, without consent of the other party, to its affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets not involving a direct competitor of the other party. A party’s sole remedy for any purported assignment by the other party in breach of this paragraph shall be, at the non-assigning party’s election, termination of your use of the Inspect Point Services upon written notice to the assigning party.
<br>
<br>

16.9  You agree that for all claims, counterclaims, disputes, and other matters arising out of or relating to this agreement, you must request consent to arbitrate from Inspect Point within 90 days from the date you know or should have known the facts giving rise to the claim, dispute or question.  Within 60 days from the date a request for arbitration is received, Inspect Point shall inform you whether it agrees to arbitrate.  If Inspect Point does not consent, you may proceed with an action in the appropriate court.  The costs of any arbitration shall be split and borne equally between the parties and such costs are not subject to shifting by the arbitrator.  The remedy for failure to comply with this provision is dismissal of the action.
<br>
<br>

16.10  In the event that any provision contained herein shall be determined to be contrary to a provision of state or federal law or to be unenforceable for any reason, then, to the extent necessary and possible to render the remainder of this Agreement enforceable, such provision may be modified or severed so as to, as nearly as possible, carry out the intention of the parties hereto, considering the purpose of the entire Agreement in relation to such provision.  The invalidation of one or more terms of this contract shall not affect the validity of the remaining terms.
